          Rooted in Farming, Growing Through Innovation
        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          At GME Company Limited, our roots run deep in the soil of Ghana. What began as a passion for farming has grown into a full-scale operation dedicated to cultivating and processing cassava into essential food products.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Today, we produce high-quality gari, banku mix, konkonte flour, and fermented cassava flour â€” nourishing homes across the country. Our commitment to quality and community drives everything we do, from planting to packaging.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We also provide farm mechanization services that support local farmers with land preparation, boosting productivity and encouraging efficient agricultural practices.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          But this is just the beginning.
